# Tic_Tac_Toe_Game
Here's a breakdown of its functionality: || Includes necessary headers: Imports the iostream, cstdlib, and ctime libraries for input/output, random number generation, and time functions, respectively. || Game Loop: Starts an infinite loop to continue the game until the user chooses to quit. || Prompts the user to enter their choice (1 to 9). Reads the user's input. || If the user chooses to quit (0), breaks out of the loop. Checks if the user's input is valid (1 to 9). If not, displays an error message and continues to the next iteration. || Generates a random computer choice. Displays the computer's choice. || Compares the user's choice with the computer's choice to determine the winner: If they are the same, it's a tie. If the user's choice beats the computer's choice according to the Tic Tac Toe rules, the user wins. Otherwise, the computer wins. || Loop Continuation: The loop continues to the next iteration, prompting the user for another choice until they decide to quit. || Output: Displays the result of the round (tie, user win, or computer win).
